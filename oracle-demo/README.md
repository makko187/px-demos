MySQL Operator for Kubernetes
=============================

The MYSQL Operator for Kubernetes is an Operator for Kubernetes managing
MySQL InnoDB Cluster setups inside a Kubernetes Cluster.

The MySQL Operator manages the full lifecycle with setup and maintenance
including automation of upgrades and backup.

Release Status
--------------
The MySQL Operator for Kubernetes currently is in a preview state.
DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION.

MySQL Operator is brought to you by the MySQL team at Oracle.

Installation of the MySQL Operator
----------------------------------

The MYSQL Operator can be installed using `kubectl`:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysql/mysql-operator/trunk/deploy/deploy-crds.yaml
```

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysql/mysql-operator/trunk/deploy/deploy-operator.yaml
```

Note: The propagation of the CRDs can take a few seconds depending on the size
of your Kubernetes cluster. Best is to wait a second or two between those
commands. If the second command fails due to missing CRD apply it a second
time.

To verify the operator is running check the deployment managing the 
operator, inside the `mysql-operator` namespace.

```sh
kubectl get deployment -n mysql-operator mysql-operator
```

Once the Operator is ready the putput should be like

``` 
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
mysql-operator   1/1     1            1           1h
```

Using the MySQL Operator to setup a MySQL InnoDB Cluster
-------------------------------------------------------

For creating an InnoDB Cluster you first have to create a secret containing
credentials for a MySQL root user which is to be created:

```
kubectl create secret generic  mypwds \
        --from-literal=rootUser=root \
        --from-literal=rootHost=% \
        --from-literal=rootPassword="your secret password, REPLACE ME"
```

With that the sample cluster can be created:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mysql/mysql-operator/trunk/samples/sample-cluster.yaml
```

This sample will create an InnoDB Cluster with three MySQL server instances
and one MySQL Router instance. The process can be observed using

```sh
kubectl get innodbcluster --watch
```

```
NAME          STATUS    ONLINE   INSTANCES   ROUTERS   AGE
mycluster     PENDING   0        3           1         10s
```

Connecting to the MYSQL InnoDB Cluster
-------------------------------------

For connecting to the InnoDB Cluster a `Service` is created inside the 
Kubernetes cluster.

```sh
kubectl get service mycluster
```

```
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                               AGE
mycluster     ClusterIP   10.43.203.248   <none>        6446/TCP,6448/TCP,6447/TCP,6449/TCP   1h
```

The exported ports represent Read-write and read-only ports for the
MySQL Protocol and the X Protocol. Using `describe` more information can be seen

```sh
kubectl describe service mycluster
```

    Name:              mycluster
    Namespace:         default
    Labels:            mysql.oracle.com/cluster=mycluster
                       tier=mysql
    Annotations:       <none>
    Selector:          component=mysqlrouter,mysql.oracle.com/cluster=mycluster,tier=mysql
    Type:              ClusterIP
    IP Families:       <none>
    IP:                10.43.203.248
    IPs:               <none>
    Port:              mysql  6446/TCP
    TargetPort:        6446/TCP
    Endpoints:         <none>
    Port:              mysqlx  6448/TCP
    TargetPort:        6448/TCP
    Endpoints:         <none>
    Port:              mysql-ro  6447/TCP
    TargetPort:        6447/TCP
    Endpoints:         <none>
    Port:              mysqlx-ro  6449/TCP
    TargetPort:        6449/TCP
    Endpoints:         <none>
    Session Affinity:  None
    Events:            <none>

Using Kubernetes port forwarding you can create a redirection from your local
machine, so that you can use any MySQL Client, like MySQL Shell or MySQL
Workbench to inspect or using the server.

For a read-write connection to the primary using MYSQL protocol:

```sh
kubectl port-forward service/mycluster mysql
```

And then in a second terminal:

```sh
mysqlsh -h127.0.0.1 -P6446 -uroot -p
```

When promted enter the password used, when creating the Secret above.
